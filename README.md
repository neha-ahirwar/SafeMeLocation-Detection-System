# SafeMeLocation-Detection-System
”SafeMe” represents an innovative response to the
pressing need for enhancing women’s safety by harnessing the
capabilities of Arduino technology. This project introduces an
advanced security system that seamlessly integrates cutting-edge
sensors and modules, establishing a new standard for real-time
protection. By incorporating features like force motion activation,
”SafeMe” transcends mere technological advancement to embody
a holistic approach to women’s safety.Utilizing Arduino Uno
R3, GPS module GY-GPS6MV2, SIM900A GSM module, GY61 accelerometer, and an LCD screen, this project introduces
a creative solution for women’s protection. When the victim
triggers the switch, the Microcontroller processes data from the
accelerometer, checking it against predefined threshold values.
Upon reaching the threshold, the GPS module detects the
live location in real-time, and the Microcontroller sends alert
messages and calls containing the victim’s location in latitude and
longitude, along with measured parameters, to pre-saved contacts
and the police via the GSM module. The buzzer also starts
audible alert unless switch off manually to make surrounding
people aware of danger.The LCD display visually represents the
entire process. This application not only empowers women to
overcome fear but also aids individuals in abnormal or unhealthy
situations, contributing to a comprehensive safety solution.
